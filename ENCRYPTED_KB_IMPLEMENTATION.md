# Encrypted Knowledge Base Implementation Guide

## 🎉 System Overview

Your InWord app now has a **fully encrypted, privacy-first AI memory system**. The AI develops a personalized understanding of each user over time, but **all memory is encrypted client-side** — not even you as the developer can read it.

---

## 🔐 Core Privacy Principles

✅ **Client-side encryption only** — All encryption happens on the user's device
✅ **Zero-knowledge architecture** — The server stores only encrypted ciphertext
✅ **Device-specific keys** — Each user has a unique 256-bit AES key stored in secure device storage
✅ **No admin access** — Even database admins cannot decrypt the data
✅ **Optional backup** — Users can opt-in to passphrase-based key backup (future feature)

---

## 📊 What Has Been Implemented

### ✅ **1. Database Schema**
**File:** `supabase-private-kb-schema.sql`

- Created `user_private_kb` table with Row-Level Security (RLS)
- Stores three encrypted memory sections:
  - `general_cipher` — Long-term stable facts about the user
  - `state_recent_cipher` — Rolling 30-day emotional/mental state
  - `goals_progress_cipher` — Progress tracking for each user goal
- Includes versioning for optimistic concurrency control
- **Run this SQL file in your Supabase SQL editor to create the table**

### ✅ **2. Type Definitions**
**File:** `types/kb-types.ts`

Defines the structure of unencrypted knowledge:

#### A. General Facts (Stable, Long-term)
```typescript
{
  name_or_alias: string,
  bio: string[],              // e.g., ["Software engineer", "Lives in NYC"]
  relationships: string[],    // e.g., ["Married to Alex", "Close with mom"]
  work_school: string[],
  routines: string[],         // e.g., ["Morning meditation", "Gym 3x/week"]
  preferences: string[],
  values: string[],           // e.g., ["Honesty", "Growth mindset"]
  triggers_boundaries: string[]
}
```

#### B. Recent Mental State (Rolling 30 days)
```typescript
{
  window: "last_30_days",
  dominant_emotions: string[], // e.g., ["anxious", "hopeful"]
  mood_score_avg: number,      // Average rating from last 30 days
  highs: string[],             // e.g., ["Got promoted", "Great date"]
  lows: string[],              // e.g., ["Fight with partner"]
  stressors: string[],
  protective_factors: string[], // e.g., ["Exercise routine", "Therapy"]
  red_flags: string[],         // e.g., ["Increasing isolation"]
  suggested_focus: string[]    // e.g., ["Stress management"]
}
```

#### C. Goals Progress
```typescript
{
  goals: [
    {
      goal_id: string,
      progress_notes: string[],
      progress_percent: number,  // 0-100
      next_actions: string[],
      risks_blockers: string[],
      momentum_score: number     // 0-10
    }
  ]
}
```

### ✅ **3. Encryption Layer**
**File:** `lib/encryption.ts`

- **AES-256-GCM** authenticated encryption
- **Key generation:** 256-bit random keys via `expo-crypto`
- **Encrypt/Decrypt functions** with Base64 encoding
- **Key wrapping** (PBKDF2-based) for future passphrase backup
- **Format:** `IV:Ciphertext` (12-byte IV + encrypted data)

### ✅ **4. Secure Key Storage**
**File:** `lib/secure-storage.ts`

- Uses **Expo SecureStore** (iOS Keychain / Android Keystore)
- Auto-generates encryption key on first use
- Keys are hardware-protected and never leave the device
- Supports key deletion and restoration (for future backup feature)

### ✅ **5. KB Manager**
**File:** `services/kb-manager.ts`

Core business logic:

- **`fetchAndDecryptKB()`** — Fetch encrypted KB from Supabase, decrypt locally
- **`encryptAndSaveKB()`** — Encrypt and save to Supabase with optimistic locking
- **`smartMergeKB()`** — Intelligently merge AI updates (deduplicates, limits sizes)
- **`createCompactContext()`** — Generate 3-7 key facts for AI chat context
- **Conflict resolution:** Retry once if version mismatch detected

### ✅ **6. AI Extractors**
**File:** `services/kb-extractors.ts`

Three specialized Gemini prompts:

1. **`extractGeneralFacts()`** — Extracts stable life facts from journal entries
2. **`updateRecentState()`** — Analyzes last 30 days for emotional patterns
3. **`updateGoalsProgress()`** — Tracks progress on each user goal

These run **in parallel** after each journal entry and return **strictly valid JSON**.

### ✅ **7. Journal Integration**
**File:** `app/(tabs)/journal.tsx`

After user submits a journal entry:
1. Create journal entry in database
2. Generate AI reflection
3. **Update KB in background** (non-blocking):
   - Fetch last 30 days of entries
   - Run AI extractors
   - Smart-merge into KB
   - Encrypt and save

### ✅ **8. AI Chat Integration**
**Files:** `services/gemini.ts`, `app/(tabs)/insights.tsx`

When user opens a chat:
1. Decrypt KB locally
2. Create compact context (3-7 facts, 2-4 highlights, 1-2 goals)
3. Pass context to Gemini with journal entry
4. AI provides **personalized, context-aware responses**

The AI "remembers" things like:
- User's goals and progress
- Recent emotional patterns
- Values, preferences, routines
- Stressors and protective factors

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
```bash
# In your Supabase SQL editor:
# Copy and paste contents of supabase-private-kb-schema.sql
# Click "Run" to create the table and policies
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies (Already Done)
The following packages were added:
- `expo-secure-store` — Secure key storage
- `expo-crypto` — Random key generation

### Step 3: Test the System
1. **Create a journal entry** — The KB will auto-update in background
2. **Open AI chat** — The AI will use encrypted context for personalized responses
3. **Check console logs** — Look for:
   - `🔑 No encryption key found. Generating new key...` (first time only)
   - `🧠 Extracting KB updates from journal entry...`
   - `✅ KB updated successfully`
   - `🔐 Loading KB context for chat...`

---

## 🔍 How It Works

### First Time User Flow:
1. User creates account and journals for the first time
2. System generates 256-bit encryption key → stores in device Keychain/Keystore
3. After journal entry, AI analyzes text and extracts insights
4. Insights are encrypted using device key
5. Encrypted ciphertext uploaded to Supabase (admin sees only gibberish)

### Returning User Flow:
1. User journals again
2. System retrieves encryption key from secure storage
3. Fetches encrypted KB from Supabase
4. Decrypts KB locally (never sent to server)
5. AI analyzes new entry + last 30 days
6. Merges new insights with existing KB
7. Re-encrypts and uploads updated KB

### Chat Flow:
1. User opens chat about a journal entry
2. System decrypts KB locally
3. Creates compact summary (7-10 key facts)
4. Sends summary + entry to Gemini
5. AI responds with personalized insights
6. **KB context never leaves device in plaintext**

---

## 🛡️ Security Model

### What IS encrypted:
✅ All user facts, emotions, goals, progress notes
✅ Stored as Base64-encoded ciphertext in Supabase
✅ Only decrypted on user's device with their unique key

### What is NOT encrypted:
❌ Journal entry text (stored in `journal_entries` table)
❌ AI insights/reflections (stored in `insights` table)
❌ Chat messages (stored in `chat_messages` table)

> **Note:** If you want to encrypt journal entries too, we can add that as Phase 2.

### Threat Model Protection:
✅ **Database breach** → Attacker gets encrypted KB (useless without keys)
✅ **Rogue admin** → Cannot decrypt user data
✅ **Man-in-the-middle** → Supabase uses TLS/HTTPS
✅ **Device theft** → Key protected by OS-level security (biometrics/PIN)

### Known Limitations:
⚠️ **Lost device without backup = lost KB** (by design for max security)
⚠️ **Gemini API sees decrypted context** (necessary for AI features)
⚠️ **Multi-device sync not yet implemented** (keys are device-specific)

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements (Not Yet Implemented)

### 1. **Opt-in Key Backup System**
**Files to create:**
- `components/KeyBackupModal.tsx` — UI for setting up passphrase
- `services/key-backup.ts` — Wrap key with PBKDF2-derived KEK

**Flow:**
1. User sets a strong passphrase
2. System derives Key Encryption Key (KEK) from passphrase using PBKDF2 (100k iterations)
3. Wraps user's encryption key with KEK
4. Uploads wrapped key to `encrypted_key_backup` column
5. On new device: user enters passphrase → derives KEK → unwraps key → restores access

### 2. **Manual "Rebuild My Insights" Button**
Let users trigger a full KB rebuild by re-analyzing last 30-90 days of entries.

### 3. **Privacy Indicator UI**
Add a badge showing:
- "`🔐 Your AI memory is encrypted — only your device can read it`"
- Last KB update timestamp
- Number of facts stored

### 4. **Monthly Year Summary**
Currently `year_summary` field exists but isn't populated. Add monthly cron job to summarize last year's data.

### 5. **Multi-Device Sync**
Encrypt keys with user password, enable sync across devices via Supabase Auth.

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [x] Encryption key auto-generated on first use
- [x] KB updates after journal entry
- [x] KB context loaded in AI chat
- [ ] Test with 30+ days of entries (state window)
- [ ] Test version conflict resolution (concurrent writes)
- [ ] Test on iOS device (Keychain)
- [ ] Test on Android device (Keystore)
- [ ] Test key deletion and regeneration
- [ ] Verify encrypted data in Supabase (should be unreadable)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "expo-secure-store could not be found"
**Solution:** Run `npm install` and restart Expo dev server

### Issue: KB not updating after journal entry
**Check console logs for:**
- API errors from Gemini (rate limits, invalid key)
- Encryption errors
- Database RLS policy errors

**Debug with:**
```typescript
console.log("KB update started");
// Check if updateKBInBackground is being called
```

### Issue: Chat feels impersonal (not using KB context)
**Check:**
1. `kbContext` is not null in `insights.tsx`
2. Gemini prompt includes `PRIVATE CONTEXT` section
3. KB has actual data (not empty)
